      <ul>
        <li><b>1980-1999</b> - Pretty good chance this is around the time The Tank was born.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>2012</b> - After graduating from high school he bought a camera.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>2017</b> - Maybe "The Tank" bought another camera around this time...</li>
				<br>
				<li><b>2020's</b> - Around the time he dug his lake & took this picture.</li>
